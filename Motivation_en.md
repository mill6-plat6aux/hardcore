## Motivation

When Netscape Communications and Microsoft opened up all the controls of the DOM after a mud-slinging skirmish, you should have taken the implications more seriously.

Web application source code is still pure chaos. It is a testament to the tremendous receptivity of the aforementioned mother browser they spawned.

However, I can no longer stand it when a smug-looking web designer steps into a development site and refreshingly disrupts the screen with just a few lines of code. I believe that the expressive power of the HTML/CSS markup language itself has reached its limits.

I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding, but I have the utmost respect for designers. Without their work, there would be no customers who would find value in my code. That is why I want to receive from them the essence of their deliverables, which is the design itself. There is no need for them to visit the development site.

And we programmers have JavaScript. Let's talk about the future with our clients, with designers, with JavaScript alone.

## About the Client Framework

We programmers have a responsibility. We invited the designers to the development site, handed them a PC and an editor, and went out for a cup of specialty coffee, all the while pretending that in the future, your job will be coding as well.

After the coffee break, there lay the chimera: React, Angular, Sass.... They had taken the markup language and extended it, in a mischievous way, to the point of abandoning its purity as a declarative language to incorporate freshly-learned control syntax.

No longer would they need the help of programmers; the web designers alone would be able to shape the future for their clients. I said, “Well, all right.” and was about to leave for Rwanda in search of the perfect specialty coffee. At that moment, the Chimera began to run amok.

The code is limp and shaky, the transpiler spits out badly seasoned spaghetti. We are called back to the development site.

## About AltJS

It's true that JavaScript sometimes smells a bit old. That's why I understand the efforts of the AltJS project and the relentless work of porting existing languages to other platforms, as they gleam brilliantly on GitHub.

But in the end, what is deployed in the browser is Pure JavaScript, not some hypothetical language in an ideal world you wrote. And what I find particularly intolerable is that it is not code written by your own hands, but code that has been mangled by a transpiler.

I understand the yearning for the pure-bloodedness of pure functional languages. They are good for churning out ideational algorithms in the bedroom, but the code required by clients is usually code with raucous I/O. Don't you think that the contribution to quality of the code that you have contributed to Idea is negligible?

Static typing, pure functions, they just seem to bind up the thoughts of myself and my friends, but on the other hand, the feedback from the category theory is very interesting. However, I think we can crawl to that height with Pure JavaScript alone.
